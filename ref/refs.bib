        abstract = {The present work used an in-house code (FASTEST) for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Finite Volume Method applied to the flow over a flat plate influenced by plasma actuators. The actuators were modeled using experimental data (from PIV) for a precise evaluation of the plasma body force and its fluid mechanic effects. This method is proven and found to have a good accuracy suitable for a quantitative analysis of the proposed test cases. Tollmien-Schlichting waves were artificially excited upstream the actuators position. The waves develop downstream of the excitation point and are amplified in certain frequency modes. The use of plasma actuators can attenuate or cancel the Tollmien-Schlichting waves. This process can be used for turbulence delay and reduction of drag coefficients in aircraft wings. Several modes of operation of the plasma actuators were tested in different arrangements and power supply. For cycle operational mode of the plasma actuator, one sensor was used a few millimeters downstream the actuator and the setup parameters are optimized with the help of an optimization algorithm. Linear Stability Analysis was also performed with the data obtained from Direct Numerical Simulations to investigate the influence of the actuator in the flow stability proprieties.}

      abstract = {A brief review of laminar flow control techniques is given and a strategy for achieving laminarization for transonic transport aircraft is discussed. A review of some flight-test results on swept-wing transition is presented. It is also shown that polished leading edges can create large regions of laminar flow because the flight environment is relatively turbulence free and the surface finish reduces the initial amplitude of the stationary crossflow vortex.},

   abstract = {A forward-facing step (FFS) immersed in a subsonic boundary layer is studied through a high-order flux reconstruction (FR) method to highlight the flow transition induced by the step. The step height is a third of the local boundary-layer thickness. The Reynolds number based on the step height is 720. Inlet disturbances are introduced giving rise to streamwise vortices upstream of the step. It is observed that these small-scale streamwise structures interact with the step and hairpin vortices are quickly developed after the step leading to flow transition in the boundary layer.},
